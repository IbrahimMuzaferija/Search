## Introduction

The main objective of this project is an JAVA application that implements various search algorithms to solve 3x3 puzzle. The puzzle initial states are read from puzzle .txt files available in project root file, and search algorithms are used to find set of actions that will order the puzzle in solution state. The search algorithm explores different actions and puzzle states after specific action to find optimum solution. The application implements following search algorithms: Breath First Search, Uninform Cost Search, Depth First Search, Limited Depth First Search, Iterative Deepening Search, Greedy Breath First Search, A* Search and Beam Search.
